          "## 3. Personal Development",
          "Sales is the ultimate school for personal growth. You learn to communicate, negotiate, deal with rejection, and persevere. These skills are valuable in every aspect of your life, not just your career.",
          "## 4. Entrepreneurial Experience",

          "## Step 1: Brand Ambassador",
          "As a Brand Ambassador, you learn the fundamentals of sales and customer relationships. You work directly with customers, develop your communication skills, and get to know the products and services inside and out. This phase typically lasts 3-6 months.",
          "## Step 2: Senior Brand Ambassador",
          "After proving your skills and achieving consistent results, you become a Senior Brand Ambassador. You get more responsibility, mentor new team members, and develop your leadership qualities.",

          "In sales, it's all about relationships. A satisfied customer comes back and refers others. But how do you build relationships that truly last? These are the techniques our top performers use.",
          "## Listen More Than You Talk",
          "The best salespeople are excellent listeners. Before presenting a solution, you must first truly understand your customer's situation. Ask open questions and actively listen to the answers.",
          "## Be Authentic",
          "Customers can tell when you're not genuine. Be yourself, give honest advice - even if it means missing a deal in the short term. This builds the trust that leads to long-term relationships.",
          "## Deliver More Than You Promise",
          "Under-promise and over-deliver is a classic but effective strategy. Surprise your customers with extra value, faster service, or unexpected attention. These small extras make the difference.",
          "## Stay in Touch",
          "Relationships wither without maintenance. Contact your customers regularly - not just when you want to sell something. A check-in to ask how things are going shows you care about them as a person, not just as a source of income.",
          "## Solve Problems Quickly",
          "Problems inevitably arise. How you handle them defines your relationship. Respond quickly, take responsibility, and focus on solutions. A well-solved problem can even strengthen the relationship.",
          "## Ask for Feedback",
          "Actively ask for feedback from your customers. This shows you value their opinion and gives you valuable insights to improve your service. Plus, customers who give feedback feel more engaged."

          "## Embrace Social Selling",
          "LinkedIn, Instagram, and even TikTok are powerful tools for sales. Build your personal brand, share valuable content, and connect with potential customers on platforms where they are active. At RTT Commerce, we see every day how social media generates leads.",
          "## Invest in Personal Branding",
          "In 2024, people buy from people, not companies. Work on your personal brand. What makes you unique? Why would a customer want to work with you? A strong personal brand opens doors that would otherwise remain closed.",
          "## Master Video Communication",
          "Video calls have become standard. Make sure your setup is professional - good lighting, quiet background, stable internet connection. Practice your camera presence until it feels natural.",
          "## Work Data-Driven",
          "Modern sales is all about data. Use CRM systems, analyze your results, and adjust your approach based on what the numbers tell you. Intuition is valuable, but data makes you objectively better.",
          "## Develop Emotional Intelligence",
          "In a world full of automation, human connection becomes more important than ever. Work on your EQ - the ability to recognize, understand, and influence emotions. This is what distinguishes top sellers from average performers.",
          "## Keep Learning",
          "The sales world doesn't stand still and neither should you. Read books, follow podcasts, attend trainings. At RTT Commerce, we offer continuous education to our teams because we know that standing still means falling behind.",
          "## Build Resilience",
          "Rejection is part of sales. The best salespeople don't get discouraged by a 'no'. They learn from it and move on. Work on your mental resilience - it's perhaps the most important skill of all."

          "## Flexibility",
          "As a Brand Ambassador, you have the freedom to develop your own approach. Of course, there are goals to achieve, but how you do it is up to you. This autonomy makes the work varied and challenging.",
          "## Challenges",
          "Let's be honest - sales is not always easy. You will hear 'no', lose deals, and experience setbacks. But with the right mindset and support from your team, these challenges become opportunities for growth.",
          "## The Rewards",
          "In addition to a competitive income, working as a Brand Ambassador offers intangible rewards: personal growth, a strong network, and the satisfaction of building your own success. Our people choose this career and stay because it changes lives.",
